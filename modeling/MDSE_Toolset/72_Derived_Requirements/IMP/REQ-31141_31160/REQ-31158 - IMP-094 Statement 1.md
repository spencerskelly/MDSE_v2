# IMP-094 — Candidate Requirement 1

> [!warning] Unapproved model interpretation
> The source rule is **Active**, but this is a **Draft candidate statement**, not an independent approved requirement. Its segmentation, wording, duplication and applicability must be reviewed before promotion or new implementation work.

## Candidate obligation

`## Source: EA` carries one EA GUID, the note's own, as the re-import identity.

## Authoritative origin

- [[IMP-094]] — exact source rule and decision origins
- [[IMP-094 - Analysis]] — clause decomposition and current classification
- Source family: `IMP`; semantic role: Import Functional Requirement; source phase `P1`
- This is one of 2 initial segments. It may need further splitting, combining or deduplication.

## Use cases requiring this candidate

- [[UC-00001 - Import an Engineering Model]]
- [[UC-00008 - Correct or Complete Knowledge]]
- [[UC-00009 - Review and Resolve Flagged Model Items]]
- [[UC-00003 - Explore Element Relationships]]
- [[UC-00005 - Explore Complete Product Context]]
- [[UC-00002 - Search for a Part, Function or Design]]

## Logical functions supported

- [[BEH-00002 - Ingest and Reconcile Engineering Sources]]
- [[BEH-00007 - Maintain and Improve Model Knowledge]]
- [[BEH-00004 - Query and Traverse Model Relationships]]
- [[BEH-00003 - Discover and Resolve Model Elements]]

## Existing software architecture candidates

- [[OBJ-00001 - MDSE Importer]]
- [[OBJ-00002 - MDSE Core]]

This is an analysis of responsibilities, **not an approved SysML allocation**.

## Verification relationship

- Proposed case: [[VER-31084 - IMP-094 Rule Verification]]
- Acceptance criteria: must be derived and reviewed individually from the candidate obligation
- Executed result: none established
- Rule conflict / supersession review: required before making this an enforceable acceptance criterion

## SysML v2

> Candidate SysML definition. Parser acceptance and full native relationship semantics have not been established for this pilot.
