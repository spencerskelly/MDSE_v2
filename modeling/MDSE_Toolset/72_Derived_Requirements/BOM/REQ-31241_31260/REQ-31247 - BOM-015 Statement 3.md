# BOM-015 — Candidate Requirement 3

> [!warning] Unapproved model interpretation
> The source rule is **Active**, but this is a **Draft candidate statement**, not an independent approved requirement. Its segmentation, wording, duplication and applicability must be reviewed before promotion or new implementation work.

## Candidate obligation

Part numbers are read as text.

## Authoritative origin

- [[BOM-015]] — exact source rule and decision origins
- [[BOM-015 - Analysis]] — clause decomposition and current classification
- Source family: `BOM`; semantic role: BOM Functional Requirement; source phase `P2`
- This is one of 5 initial segments. It may need further splitting, combining or deduplication.

## Use cases requiring this candidate

- [[UC-00001 - Import an Engineering Model]]
- [[UC-00005 - Explore Complete Product Context]]

## Logical functions supported

- [[BEH-00002 - Ingest and Reconcile Engineering Sources]]
- [[BEH-00004 - Query and Traverse Model Relationships]]

## Existing software architecture candidates

- [[OBJ-00001 - MDSE Importer]]

This is an analysis of responsibilities, **not an approved SysML allocation**.

## Verification relationship

- Proposed case: [[VER-31126 - BOM-015 Rule Verification]]
- Acceptance criteria: must be derived and reviewed individually from the candidate obligation
- Executed result: none established
- Rule conflict / supersession review: required before making this an enforceable acceptance criterion

## SysML v2

> Candidate SysML definition. Parser acceptance and full native relationship semantics have not been established for this pilot.
