# GOV-002 — Candidate Requirement 1

> [!warning] Unapproved model interpretation
> The source rule is **Active**, but this is a **Draft candidate statement**, not an independent approved requirement. Its segmentation, wording, duplication and applicability must be reviewed before promotion or new implementation work.

## Candidate obligation

Tools are written in TypeScript and share one core library.

## Authoritative origin

- [[GOV-002]] — exact source rule and decision origins
- [[GOV-002 - Analysis]] — clause decomposition and current classification
- Source family: `GOV`; semantic role: Governance / Process Constraint; source phase `Standing`
- This is one of 2 initial segments. It may need further splitting, combining or deduplication.

## Use cases requiring this candidate

- [[UC-00001 - Import an Engineering Model]]
- [[UC-00008 - Correct or Complete Knowledge]]

## Logical functions supported

- [[BEH-00002 - Ingest and Reconcile Engineering Sources]]
- [[BEH-00007 - Maintain and Improve Model Knowledge]]

## Existing software architecture candidates

- [[OBJ-00002 - MDSE Core]]
- [[OBJ-00004 - MDSE Base Vault]]

This is an analysis of responsibilities, **not an approved SysML allocation**.

## Verification relationship

- Proposed case: [[VER-31002 - GOV-002 Rule Verification]]
- Acceptance criteria: must be derived and reviewed individually from the candidate obligation
- Executed result: none established
- Rule conflict / supersession review: required before making this an enforceable acceptance criterion

## SysML v2

> Candidate SysML definition. Parser acceptance and full native relationship semantics have not been established for this pilot.

```sysml
package MDSE_REQ_31003 {
    requirement def RuleREQ31003 {
        doc /* Tools are written in TypeScript and share one core library. */
    }
}
