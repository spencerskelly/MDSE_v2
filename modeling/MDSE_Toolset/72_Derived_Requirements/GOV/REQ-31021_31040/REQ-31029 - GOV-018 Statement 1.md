# GOV-018 — Candidate Requirement 1

> [!warning] Unapproved model interpretation
> The source rule is **Active**, but this is a **Draft candidate statement**, not an independent approved requirement. Its segmentation, wording, duplication and applicability must be reviewed before promotion or new implementation work.

## Candidate obligation

Final folder structure follows the EA package structure. 99_System is kept and edited topic by topic.

## Authoritative origin

- [[GOV-018]] — exact source rule and decision origins
- [[GOV-018 - Analysis]] — clause decomposition and current classification
- Source family: `GOV`; semantic role: Governance / Process Constraint; source phase `Standing`
- This is one of 2 initial segments. It may need further splitting, combining or deduplication.

## Use cases requiring this candidate

- No directly matching Engineering Knowledge Base interaction has been established; evaluate the broader tool lifecycle.

## Logical functions supported

- No functional link approved yet; cross-cutting governance may apply.

## Existing software architecture candidates

- [[OBJ-00002 - MDSE Core]]
- [[OBJ-00004 - MDSE Base Vault]]

This is an analysis of responsibilities, **not an approved SysML allocation**.

## Verification relationship

- Proposed case: [[VER-31012 - GOV-018 Rule Verification]]
- Acceptance criteria: must be derived and reviewed individually from the candidate obligation
- Executed result: none established
- Rule conflict / supersession review: required before making this an enforceable acceptance criterion

## SysML v2

> Candidate SysML definition. Parser acceptance and full native relationship semantics have not been established for this pilot.
